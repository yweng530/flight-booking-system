# Project Title: Flight Application

# Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to build a web application using the data set of Airlines and passenger purchase and rating records, so as to obtain the average rating of flights and average rating of Airlines. Passengers can locate and rate specific flight, and both passenger and Airlines can modify flight information and access the ratings of flights and Airlines.

Here is the link to our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction?select=Clean_Dataset.csv


# Description
We plan to design a web application which allows passenger to locate flight message according to the start city, end city, airport, airlines, and so on. Passenger will be able to find the flights they need upon entering the source city, destination city, and the latest arrival time. Users can also find the  cheapest ticket price of difference classes for a flight after entering the FlightCode.

# Usefulness
Our application will enable users to find the flights they need, and get the price and other information about flight. As an international student who travels a lot, I find this application would be very useful to our trip.

# Realness
Our schema is large, mutiple entities are related in many ways, so we could not find really fitting data, and for privacy purpose, airline companies do not share their customer information. We will be using generated data for this project.

# Functionality
Users would be able to make following interactions with the application:
1. Airline companies should be able to log in and add, delete, or modify the flight information after logging in. (Update, Delete, Create)  
2. Passengers and Airlines should be able to input the source city, destination city, latest arrival time, and get the FlightCode of matching    
3. Enter the flight code, to receive the flights information like prices, duration, flight rating, and Airline average ratings. (Search, Read)

# Project Work Distribution
Our team distributies the work of the project based on each memberâ€™s preferences and technical experiences. We plan to meet weekly on zoom to complete the project together. The details are as following:

Yutong Li & Ye Yu:Airlines should be able to log in and add, delete, or modify the flight information after logging in. (Update, Delete, Create)
Passengers and Airlines should be able to input the source city, destination city, latest arrival time, and get the FlightCode of matching (Search, Read) 

Boning Wang & Yuhua Weng: Enter the flight code, to receive the flights information like prices, duration, flight rating, and Airline average ratings. (Search, Read) They will also be implementing frontend.

Passengers can rate the specific flights. (Search, Read)
